EASYWIG - The Easy Wizywig
==========================
Welcome to Easywig
------------------
Easywig has it's name from being an Easy-installed Wizywig-editor. Easywig has it's name from being an Easy-installed Wizywig-editor. With one single javascript-include and a font-awesome link you have access to a fully and well working wizywig editor.
It has all of the essential features to start writing content including linking, font-size shifts and colors. There's also the possibility to shift between code and visual editor which enables full customization of your content.
Other Wizywig editors have more features than Easywig, but demand a higher effort regarding installation. We want to make it easy for people who have a limited knowledge regarding javascript code to install and use a Wizywig editor in your blog or CMS.

Installation
------------
Installation is easy. All you have to do is download the editor (next section) and include it in your page where you want the Easywig to appear. In the same page, also create a div with id="easywig". If you want the Icons to work properly, you also need to include fontawesome CDN. You do that [here](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/).
However, you need to define what happens to the text in the editor in a separate file. In the file you have settings in the top where you define the path to this file. After this it's up to you if you want to save the information in a sessison, database or other.
If you do not understand JavaScript-code, we strongly recommend you to leave all other code alone to be able to function. Easywig contains all you need to set up a simple Wizywig-editor. If you want more to be able to function and understand JavaScript code, we recommend you to visit [this website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) and include other functions in the same way Easywig does...
